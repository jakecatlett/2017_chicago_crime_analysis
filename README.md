Exploratory analysis of Chicago crime trends.

Repo contains a Powerpoint presentation which was used as my final submission for my analytics capstone project at Southern New Hampshire University.

The R code used to make all calculations and visualizations in the presentation is included as well, as is the code that was used for subsetting the data set.

The chicago_crimes.csv data set included is the publicly avaialable historic crime data set distributed by the Chicago of Chicago Police Department in the state it was in when used for this analysis in late 2017.

The full, updated data set can be accessed here.  Please note that using the fully updated dataset will not produce the same results as shown in the attached report.:
